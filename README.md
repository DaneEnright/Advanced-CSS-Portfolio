# <Personal Webpage showcasing Work Portfolio>

## Description

Built this project from scratch to get more familiar with HTML and Advanced CSS as well as learn how to upload my work to GitHub.

This was a coding assignment where we built our own webpage from scratch using HTML and Advanced CSS. The goal was to make this a portfolio/resume to showcase our projects to future employers.

Learned a lot more about these html and css languages and how they work together.
