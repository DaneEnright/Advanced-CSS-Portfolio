# <Javascript Password Generator>

## Description

Built this project with some starter code to get more familiar with HTML and Javascript as well as learn how to upload my work to GitHub.

This was a coding assignment where we built our own Javascript extenstion using some starter code from HTML and Advanced CSS. The goal was to make a page that could create a random password based on inputs from the user.

Learned a lot more about these HTML and Javascript and how they work together.
